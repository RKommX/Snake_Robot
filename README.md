# Snake-like Robot Modelling and Navigation

[Project Description](https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-Simulink-Challenge-Project-Hub)

## Project Details
This repository contains a Simscape Multibody model of a snake-like robot. It has 6 links and is controlled by the LOS guidance law to move in a straight line. The serpenoid curve equation was used to govern its gait pattern.

## How to run
To run the model, Simscape Multibody is needed to solve the kinematics. Before running the .slx file, make sure the Parameters.mat file is downloaded.
